# These constraints describe the physical pin relationship the controller owns:
# the inverted DDIO-forwarded SDRAM_CLK, the command/address/write-data launch,
# and the DDIO falling-edge DQ capture. That relationship is part of the
# controller's contract, so it is constrained here beside the controller
# rather than in the core SDC.
#
# Integration requirements:
# - Read this file AFTER the core SDC that runs `derive_pll_clocks`, so the
#   controller clock already exists when the generated pin clock is derived.
#   `files.qip` lists it after Loopy.sdc for that reason.
# - Set `sdram_ctrl_clk_pin` below to the PLL output pin driving the controller.
#   That single line is the only core-specific coupling in this file.
# - Crossings between the controller wrapper and the core's slower clock stay in
#   the core SDC. Those are integration timing, not pin timing.
